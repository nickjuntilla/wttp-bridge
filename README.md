# Web2 to Web3 (WTTP) Gateway

WTTP Gateway redirects WTTP requests through an embedded RPC in the browser. Query contract addresses after wttp.
The server must be configured to send all requests back to index.html like a single page app.

## To run

`yarn` or `npm install`

`yarn run start`

## Deploy

Build to dist: `yarn run build`

Deploy your dist to static hosting and set your routes to point back to index.html just like in a react app or SPA.

To serve a single domain route a domain to a single contract address.

### Examples

- http://localhost:5000/wttp/0x9C29F0eE3D59dFea70D616f4776F7649dA364342
- http://localhost:5000/wttp/0x61ba60374e0CF9a51aD846853b08B09FC163896a
- http://localhost:5000/wttp/0xaD7A50341F4Cc6C792fAc35D3e6A67eA1750EDBc
